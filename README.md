# My Cool Blog 

### Built with React, gathered using Webpack

## How to Run it locally:

1.  Clone repository to your machine with `git clone <repo_url>` and enter to the new created folder 

2.  Call `yarn` to install dependencies

3.  Call `yarn start:api` to start json-server fake API on port 3000

4.  Call `yarn start:app` to start application dev server

5. Navigate your web-browser to `localhost:4000`

6. Enjoy

7. If its too complicated, `yarn start` will run both servers together

## Technology used:

* Typescript v.3 - beacose type safe rules
* React v.16 - just for fun
* Redux v.4 - to look more serious
* Typesafe Actions v.2 - for cleaner redux-related code
* Webpack v.4 - how to live without it?

## Future plans:

* Move markup on Pug and Stylus
* Finish with category sorting
* Implement normal backend with Koa and Typescript
* Add admin part to enter posts
* Implement user authentication and posts commenting
