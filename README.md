## How to Run it locally:

1.  Clone repository to your machine with `git clone <repo_url>` and enter to the new created folder 

2.  Call `yarn` to install dependencies

3.  Call `yarn start:api` to start json-server fake API on port 3000

4.  Call `yarn start:app` to start application dev server

5. Navigate your web-browser to `localhost:4000`

* Typescript v.3.1.3 - beacose types safe rules
* React v.16 - just for fun
